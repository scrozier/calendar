    <h2>Accomodations</h2>
    <p>You are welcome to stay with me. Daughter Emily says my fancy air mattress is quite
      comfy. <i>However</i>, my apartment is quite small (730 sq ft) and you would be literally
      sleeping in the kitchen, if I actually had a kitchen. Instead, I have a
      living room/kitchen/office/music room/dining room. So aside from family members,
      you would probably find it a bit more intimate than would be optimal.</p>
    <p><i>So</i>, I have compiled a list of hotels within walking distance of my apartment.
      I haven't checked all of these out yet, except online, where all of them have very good
      to excellent ratings.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that lower Manhattan (downtown), and the Lower East Side in particular (where I live,
      and where these hotels are) is more trendy, artsy, night life-y, and potentially "gritty"
      than midtown, uptown, and the Financial District. So these hotels are going to be smaller,
      boutique, artsy kinds of places, generally.
    <h3>The hotels</h3>
    <h2>Holiday Inn NYC, Lower East Side</h2>
    <img width=453 height=250 src="https://www.ticati.com/img/hotel/2250060s.jpg" alt="Holiday Inn NYC Lower East Side" />
    <p>Pretty standard Holiday Inn. It has the distinct advantage of being literally across the
      street from my building. Staff is great, rooms are very decent. It just has no character to
      speak of. It's the least expensive option by a bit, and the proximity to me is a plus.</p>
    <p class="price">$200</p>
    <p class="distance">3 minute walk</p>

    <h2>Hotel on Rivington</h2>
